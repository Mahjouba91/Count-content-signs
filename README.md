# Count-content-signs
Count the number of signs (characters + whitespaces) of a WordPress post (TinyMCE editor).

This is a fork of the following plugin : https://wordpress.org/plugins/count-content-characters/

Changes :
* Add french translation
* Tweak : The count of signs is now in real time when you're editing you're content
* Tweak : Also count the white spaces (signs = characters + white spaces)
