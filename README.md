# Count-content-signs
Count the number of signs (characters + whitespaces) of a WordPress post (TinyMCE editor).

Changes :
* New : Add french translation
* Edit : Use native function of WordPress (word count) to count chars with spaces
* Tweak : Better performances
* Tweak : The count of signs is now in real time (every 500ms) when you're editing you're content (only update the count if the content lenght has changed)
* Tweak : Also count the white spaces (signs = characters + white spaces)
